= Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Open Liberty

Learn how to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Open Liberty without writing Java code.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to add two server configurations to enable CORS.
Next, you will write and run tests to validate that the CORS configurations work. These tests send two different CORS requests to a REST service that has two different endpoints.

=== CORS and its purpose

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a W3C specification and mechanism that you can use to request restricted
resources from a domain outside the current domain. In other words, CORS is a
technique for consuming an API served from an origin different than yours.

CORS is useful for requesting data such as images, videos, scripts, style sheets, iFrames, web fonts,
and many other kinds of data from websites other than yours.

However, you cannot request resources from outside of your website domain without asking for
permission from the other website domains. In JavaScript, cross-origin requests with an `XMLHttpRequest` API and Ajax
cannot happen unless CORS is enabled in the server that is receiving the request. Otherwise, same-origin security policy prevents the requests.

A web page that is served from the `\http://aboutcors.com` server sends a request to get data to the
`\http://openliberty.io` server. Because of security concerns, browsers block the server response unless
the server adds HTTP response headers to allow the web page to consume the data.

Different ports and different protocols also trigger CORS. For example, the `\http://abc.xyz:1234` domain is considered to be different from the `\https://abc.xyz:4321` domain.

Open Liberty has built-in support for CORS that gives you an easy and powerful way to configure the
runtime to handle CORS requests without the need to write Java code.

=== Types of CORS requests

Familiarize yourself with two kinds of CORS requests to understand
the attributes that you will add in the two CORS configurations.

==== Simple CORS request

According to the CORS specification, an HTTP request is a simple CORS request if the request method is `GET`, `HEAD`, or `POST`. The header fields are any one of the `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `Content-Language`, or `Content-Type` headers. The `Content-Type` header has a value of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`,
or `text/plain`.

When clients, such as browsers, send simple CORS requests to servers on different domains, the clients include an
`Origin` header with the client host name as the value. If the server allows the origin, the server includes an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with a list of allowed origins or an asterisk (*) in the response back to the client. The asterisk indicates that all origins are allowed to access the endpoint on the server.

==== Preflight CORS request

A CORS request is not a simple CORS request if a client first sends a preflight CORS request before it sends the actual request. For example, the client sends a preflight request before it sends a `DELETE` HTTP request. To determine whether the request is safe to send, the client sends a preflight request, which is an `OPTIONS` HTTP request, to gather more information about the server. This preflight request has the `Origin` header and other headers to indicate the HTTP method and headers of the actual request to be sent after the preflight request.

Once the server receives the preflight request, if the origin is allowed, the server responds with headers that indicate the HTTP methods and headers that are allowed in the actual requests. The response might include more CORS-related headers.

Next, the client sends the actual request, and the server responds.

== Enabling CORS

You will use a REST service that is already provided for you to test your CORS configurations. Find the service in the
`start/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/cors/` directory.

Send the simple request to the `/configurations/simple` endpoint and the preflight request to the `/configurations/preflight` endpoint.

// =================================================================================================
// Enabling a simple CORS configuration
// =================================================================================================

=== Enabling a simple CORS configuration

Configure the server to allow the `/configurations/simple` endpoint to accept a simple CORS request.
Add a simple CORS configuration to the `server.xml` file in the `start/main/liberty/config/` directory:

[source, xml]
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[tags=simple-config]
----

The simple CORS configuration contains the following attributes:

domain:: The endpoint to be configured for CORS requests. Set the value to `/configurations/simple`.
allowedOrigins:: Origins that are allowed to access the endpoint. Set the value to `openliberty.io`.
allowedMethods:: HTTP methods that a client is allowed to use when it makes requests to the endpoint. Set the value to `GET`.
allowCredentials:: A boolean that indicates whether the user credentials can be included in the request. Set the value to `true`.
exposeHeaders:: Headers that are safe to expose to clients. Set the value to `MyHeader`.

Save the changes to the `server.xml` file. The `/configurations/simple` endpoint is now ready to be
tested with a simple CORS request.

Open `TestCors.java` file in the `start/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/cors/` directory. Add a test to test the simple CORS configuration you just added:

[source, java]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/cors/TestCors.java[tags=simpleTest]
----

The `testSimpleCorsRequest` test simulates a client. It first sends a simple CORS request to the `/configurations/simple` endpoint, and then it checks for a valid response and expected headers. Lastly, it prints the response headers for you to inspect.

The request is a `GET` HTTP request with the following header:

|===
| *Header* | *Value*
| Origin | openliberty.io
|===

Expect the following response headers and values if the simple CORS request is successful, and the server is correctly configured:

|===
| *Header* | *Value*
| Access-Control-Allow-Origin | openliberty.io
| Access-Control-Allow-Credentials | `true`
| Access-Control-Expose-Headers | `MyHeader`
|===

Go to the `start/` directory and run the following command:

```
mvn install
```

The `testSimpleCorsRequest` test passes and prints the response headers with their values from the endpoint. The
`/configurations/simple` endpoint now accepts simple CORS requests.

// Enabling a preflight CORS configuration
// =================================================================================================

=== Enabling a preflight CORS configuration

Configure the server to allow the `/configurations/preflight` endpoint to accept a preflight CORS request.
Add another CORS configuration in the `server.xml` file in the `start/main/liberty/config/` directory:

[source, xml]
----
include::finish/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml[tags=preflight-config]
----

The preflight CORS configuration has different values than the simple CORS configuration.

domain:: Set the value to `/configurations/preflight` because the `domain` is a different endpoint.
allowedOrigins:: Set the value to an asterisk (*) to allow requests from all origins.
allowedMethods:: Set the value to `OPTIONS, DELETE`.
allowCredentials:: Set the value to `true`.

Add two new attributes:

maxAge:: The number of seconds that a client can cache a response to a preflight request. Set the value to `10`.
allowedHeaders:: Headers that a client can use in requests. Set the value to `MyOwnHeader1, MyOwnHeader2`.

Save the changes to the `server.xml` file. The `/configurations/preflight` endpoint is now ready to
be tested with a preflight CORS request.

Add another test to the `TestCors.java` file in the `start/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/cors/` directory to test the preflight CORS configuration that you just added:

[source, java]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/cors/TestCors.java[tags=preflightTest]
----

The `testPreflightCorsRequest` test simulates a client sending a preflight CORS request. It first sends the request to the `/configurations/preflight` endpoint, and then it checks for a valid response and expected headers. Lastly, it prints the response headers for you to inspect.

The request is an `OPTIONS` HTTP request with the following headers:

|===
| *Header* | *Value*
| Origin | anywebsiteyoulike.com
| Access-Control-Request-Method | `DELETE`
| Access-Control-Request-Headers | `MyOwnHeader2`
|===

Expect the following response headers and values if the preflight CORS request is successful, and the server is correctly configured:

|===
| *Header* | *Value*
| Access-Control-Allow-Max-Age | 10
| Access-Control-Allow-Origin | anywebsiteyoulike.com
| Access-Control-Allow-Methods | `OPTIONS, DELETE`
| Access-Control-Allow-Credentials | `true`
| Access-Control-Allow-Headers | `MyOwnHeader1, MyOwnHeader2`
|===

The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header has a value of `anywebsiteyoulike.com`
because the server is configured to allow all origins, and the request came with an origin of
`anywebsiteyoulike.com`.

Go to the `start/` directory and run the following command:

```
mvn install
```

The `testPreflightCorsRequest` test passes and prints the response headers with their values from the endpoint.
The `/configurations/preflight` endpoint now allows preflight CORS requests.

If you want, modify the server configuration and the test code to experiment with the
various CORS configuration attributes.


// =================================================================================================
// Congratulations! You're done!
// =================================================================================================

== Great work! You're done!

You enabled CORS support in Open Liberty. You added two different
CORS configurations to allow two kinds of CORS requests in the `server.xml` file.
